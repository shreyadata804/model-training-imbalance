# 📊 **Handling Imbalanced Datasets in Environmental, Ecological, and Health Studies**

## 🌍 **Introduction**

Imbalanced datasets are a prevalent challenge in fields like **environmental science, ecology,** and **health studies,** where critical problems often hinge on detecting rare events or minority classes. Examples include identifying endangered species, predicting disease outbreaks, and spotting environmental anomalies. In these cases, the underrepresentation of crucial minority classes presents unique difficulties for data analysis and model accuracy. For instance, misclassifying rare diseases or environmental threats can have significant real-world consequences.

Addressing issues related to imbalanced datasets, such as **biased model predictions** and **poor minority class detection,** is essential to improving the reliability of predictions in these areas. This project aims to tackle these challenges and enhance model performance when working with imbalanced data.

## 🎯 **Research Objective**

The objective of this project is to develop a **structured, step-by-step pipeline** to handle imbalanced datasets specifically tailored for **environmental, ecological,** and **health studies.** Our approach aims to enhance model performance by focusing on rare event detection for both **classification** and **regression tasks.**

### 🎯 **Key Goals**
- **🔍 Improve Model Performance:** Enhance the accuracy and reliability of minority class detection, especially for rare event prediction.
- **📈 Comprehensive Coverage:** Develop a pipeline that supports both classification and regression problems.
- **🛠️ Effective Techniques:** Apply various imbalance handling techniques to improve model outcomes.
